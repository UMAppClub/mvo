# App Club Minimum Viable Organization

App Club is a tech student community at University of Malaya, in Malaysia. A bunch of students informally started it in 2016, grew it and built small structures and processes to make sure it can last, if it should.

It made our Computer Science education better, and helped us build lasting friendships. 

In this repo, we wanna open-source App Club, so you can _clone_ it in your faculty and grow as a team.

## When will this be ready?
Due out in August 2020, marking the closing of App Club's 2nd leadership term.
