# App Club Minimum Viable Organization

Due out in 2020, marking the closing of App Club's 2nd leadership term, In this document I aim to theoretically validate the little decisions that 2 generatiosn of App Club leaders have made, against the available literature in leadership, management and organization studies.

The goal is to look back at 4 years of purely experimental leadership at the scale of a faculty, study the achievements and the failures, from communication, recruitment, goal setting, training new members, event planning, initiating new programs, etc. and develop their best practices, so they can be more easily replicated.
