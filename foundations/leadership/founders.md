# Why did we start App Club

A number of reasons:
* We were spending more time getting good grades than learning stuff.
* The quality of teaching was fairly low in most of our classes.
* Faculty wasn't motivated to change anything, because as long as some of us kept scoring high and winning competitions, they could celebrate and say they're doing great, althought they weren't.
* From a social point of view, the atmosphere was _very_ damn intense. There were almost no deep friendships, and our growth was *extremely* individualistic.
* A lot of students were being left behind and felt that they weren't good enough. A lot of students (the B and C students) were open to saying they were considering, or they had considered, dropping out.
* If we didn't do something for our education, nobody else would, literally.
