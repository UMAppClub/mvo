# Why did we start App Club

Our main reasons, in November 2016, were:

* We were spending more time getting good grades than learning stuff.
* The quality of teaching was fairly low in most of our classes.
* Faculty wasn't motivated to change anything, because as long as some of us kept scoring high and winning competitions, they could celebrate and say they're doing great, althought they weren't.
* From a social point of view, the atmosphere was _very_ damn intense. There were almost no deep friendships, and our growth was *extremely* individualistic.
* A lot of students were being left behind and felt that they weren't good enough. A lot of students (the B and C students) were open to saying they were considering, or they had considered, dropping out.
* If we didn't do something for our education, nobody else would, literally.

## How did we decide to make a Club, to tackle those problems?

There were 2 things we need to achieve:
* We wanted to have control over what we learned, whom from, and how deeply 
* We wanted to learn and grow as a team and have a social element in our learning.

What inspired us to start App Club, the way we did, was Android Study Jams. Some CS students at Asia Pacific University were organizing Study Jams in late 2016 and it sounded like what we wanted. There'd be one student instructor who'd teach the rest of students, following a Google syllabus that available online.

We started App Club with an Android Class, with [Cheong Chah Wei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chah-wei-cheong-65a520111/) as our first instructor.
